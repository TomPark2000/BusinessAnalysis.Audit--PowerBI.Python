# Power BI Report - Analysis and Auditing 

## Project Overview
**This interactive Power BI report is tailored to executives and provides insights to the processes of the company. This report is a one-stop shop with several dashboards, each with a different purpose that ranges from a high level summary, to in depth analysis, to geographical coverage, to auditing.** I also designed this report to be user friendly so that anybody will be able to intuitively navigate it and find their desired insights. 

This report has data points which can be translated to several things based on the company and its industry. For example:
- Depending on the context, "issues" can represent "requests", "tasks", "cases", etc. Each "issue" has an "Open" or "Closed" status
- Depending on the context, "money" can be represent "revenue", "AUM", etc.
- Depending on the context, there is a "Type" column with three "Methods", and the "Methods" can represent different products/services, divisions of the company, delivery method, and more. For example, for a retail company, "methods" can be changed to represent their eCommerce vs. physical store data. 

I created the dummy data through Python. Dataset Features include:
- 1200 clients with a unique Client ID
- 10,000 "issues" with a unique Issue ID. 40% of issues have an Open status and 60% having a have status
- Countries with clients/issues: 50% in US, 20% in UK, 15% in Canada, and 15% distributed evenly amongst Germany, Grance, Australia, Japan, India, Brazil, and South Africa


There are **seperate but similar dashboards** within this report that analyze **either overall customer coverage or the "issues" data.** 

Software Used:
Power BI, Python, Excel

## High-Level Dashboards
I'll start by showcasing the dashboards that quickly provide high-level insights.
